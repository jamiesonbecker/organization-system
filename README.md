Notes: Try to keep words easily searchable. For example, positioning your cursor on any of the keywords and pressing # in vim will cause you to search (backwards). It's a good idea to use a standardized capitalization method somewhere. I don't like typing _ when searching, but hitting slash and typing top will search to the next top level (and then you can just keep hitting slash).

### January

*   Meeting: 1pm Monday: someone, somewhere.
    Put this in a calendar somewhere (or reminder app) as well,
    but it's also nice here because it can be moved to archives
    below as a sort of easy-to-read log. Note: no year. All of this
    gets moved to archives at the next year.
